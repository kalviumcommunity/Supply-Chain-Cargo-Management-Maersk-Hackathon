## 1. Introduction
This document defines the Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) for the **Supply Chain Cargo Management system**. These requirements specify the quality attributes and operational characteristics of the system, ensuring it is performant, reliable, secure, and scalable.

## 3. Detailed Requirements

### 3.1 Performance
- **API Response Time (High):** Standard CRUD operations and data queries must return a response in under **500 milliseconds** for the 95th percentile of requests under normal load.  
- **Page Load Time (High):** The initial load time for critical user-facing pages (e.g., main dashboard, shipment list) should be under **2 seconds**.  

### 3.2 Reliability
- **System Uptime (High):** The core shipment tracking functionality must achieve **99% availability**, which allows approximately **3.6 days of downtime per year**.  
- **Data Integrity (High):** The system must guarantee that all database transactions are **atomic**. Failed operations must be rolled back to prevent partial or corrupt data.  

### 3.3 Scalability
- **Concurrent Users (Medium):** The system must perform reliably with at least **100 users** accessing it simultaneously.  
- **Cloud Scaling (High):** The backend services will be deployed as **containers (e.g., Docker)** on a cloud platform that supports **horizontal auto-scaling** to handle load spikes.  

### 3.4 Security
- **Authentication (High):** All access to the backend API must be protected. Unauthenticated requests will be rejected. **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** will be used to manage user sessions.  
- **Authorization (High):** The system must implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.  
  - Example: A *Vendor* role should only be able to see shipments assigned to them.  
  - Example: An *Admin* role can see all shipments.  
- **Data Encryption (High):** All data in transit must use **TLS 1.2 or higher**.
