# Backend Development Workflow

**Author:** Rahul RR

**Project:** Supply Chain Cargo Management System

This document details the backend development workflow for the Supply Chain Cargo Management System. It is designed to ensure maintainability, scalability, and seamless integration with the overall system architecture. Each section provides actionable steps, best practices, and references to supporting documentation.

## Task Breakdown

### 1. Database Setup
- **Install PostgreSQL**: Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running on your system.
- **Create Database**: Create a database (e.g., `cargo_db`) and user with appropriate privileges.
- **Apply Schema**: Use the provided [`basic-schema.sql`](../server/basic-schema.sql) to create tables and relationships.
- **Validate Schema**: Cross-check with the ERD and [`schema-refinements.md`](schema-refinements.md) to ensure all constraints and indexes are in place.
- **Configure Connection**: Update [`application.properties`](../server/target/classes/application.properties) with the correct database URL, username, and password.
- **Test Connection**: Use `psql` or a database GUI to verify connectivity and schema correctness.

### 2. Layered Architecture Implementation
- **Repository Layer**: Implement Spring Data JPA repositories for each entity (e.g., `ShipmentRepository`, `CargoRepository`). This abstracts direct database access and provides CRUD operations.
- **Service Layer**: Develop services to encapsulate business logic, transaction management, and orchestration between repositories (e.g., `ShipmentService`).
- **Controller Layer**: Create REST controllers to expose API endpoints, handle request validation, and format responses (e.g., `ShipmentController`).
- **Best Practices**: Use dependency injection, keep controllers thin, and centralize business logic in services.

### 3. API Design and Testing
- **Design Endpoints**: Define RESTful endpoints for all core entities: Shipments, Cargo, Vendors, and Routes. Follow REST conventions for resource naming and HTTP methods.
- **Implement CRUD**: Ensure each entity supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
- **Error Handling**: Standardize error responses (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error) and use exception handlers.
- **Testing**: Use Postman or cURL for manual testing. Write JUnit tests for automated validation of service and controller logic.

### 4. Integration with Frontend
- **API Consumption**: Connect the Vue.js frontend to backend APIs using HTTP clients (e.g., Axios, Fetch API).
- **Data Flow Verification**: Test end-to-end data flow by performing CRUD operations from the UI and verifying backend updates.
- **CORS Configuration**: Ensure CORS is enabled in Spring Boot to allow frontend-backend communication during development.
- **Debugging**: Use browser dev tools and backend logs to trace and resolve integration issues.

### 5. Advanced Features
- **Business Logic**: Implement advanced operations such as vendor assignment to shipments and shipment status updates.
- **Pagination & Performance**: Add pagination to endpoints returning large datasets and optimize queries using indexes.
- **Security**: Integrate authentication and authorization (e.g., JWT, OAuth2) to protect sensitive endpoints.
- **Scalability**: Prepare for horizontal scaling by keeping the backend stateless and externalizing session management if needed.

### 6. Documentation and Deployment
- **API Documentation**: Document all endpoints, request/response formats, and error codes (consider using Swagger/OpenAPI).
- **Deployment Preparation**: Containerize the backend using Docker. Prepare deployment scripts for AWS, Azure, or other cloud providers.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Set up application monitoring and centralized logging for production environments.
- **Release Checklist**: Ensure all tests pass, documentation is up-to-date, and deployment steps are validated.

## Reference Documentation
- **Architecture Overview**: See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md) for system diagrams, component responsibilities, and deployment topology.
- **Backend Layered Design**: Refer to [`backend-hld-details.md`](backend-hld-details.md) for detailed explanations of each backend layer and their responsibilities.
- **Database Schema**: Review [`schema-refinements.md`](schema-refinements.md) and [`basic-schema.sql`](../server/basic-schema.sql) for entity definitions and schema constraints.
- **API and LLD**: Consult [`lld-api-outline.md`](lld-api-outline.md) and [`lld-db-queries.md`](lld-db-queries.md) for endpoint specifications and query strategies.
- **UI Integration**: See [`ui-wireframes.md`](ui-wireframes.md) and [`ui-high-fid.md`](ui-high-fid.md) for frontend structure and integration notes.

## Upcoming: Kafka Integration

After completing the basic backend and database setup, plan to integrate Apache Kafka for asynchronous event processing. This will enable real-time updates and decoupled communication between services. Key steps will include:

- Setting up a Kafka broker (locally or using a managed service).
- Implementing Kafka producers in the backend to publish events (e.g., shipment status updates).
- Creating Kafka consumers to process events and trigger downstream actions.
- Testing event flows and ensuring reliable message delivery.
